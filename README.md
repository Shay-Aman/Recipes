# Recipes App

The Recipes App lets you browse a list of delicious meals fetched from an online source.

Each recipe in the list shows:
- Name

- Nutritional info: fats, calories, and carbs

When you tap on a recipe, its data is securely encrypted.  
As you enter the details screen, you’ll be asked to authenticate using fingerprint or face recognition.  
Once verified, the recipe is decrypted and displayed with:
- A larger image
- Full nutritional information
- A detailed description

This app is simple, private, and easy to use — giving you secure access to tasty recipe information.
